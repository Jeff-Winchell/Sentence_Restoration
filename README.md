# Sentence_Restoration
Sentence Restoration from Automated Speech Recognition Transcripts. Unlike Sentence Boundary Disambiguation or Punctuation Restoration, this project has the limited but important (from an NLP perspective) task of taking automated speech transcripts which have zero punctuation and building sentences from them, necessary for all downstream NLP tasks.
